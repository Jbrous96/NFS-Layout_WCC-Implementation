# LAYOUT_WCC: Enhanced NFS File System Management

## TL;DR
LAYOUT_WCC extends NFSv4.2 with a new operation for efficient attribute updates across distributed servers. Reduces network traffic by allowing selective mirror updates and eliminating redundant attribute checks. Built with Python 3.8+, provides async I/O support and robust error handling.

## What is This? (eli5) ðŸ¤”
Imagine you have important files stored across multiple computers (servers) in different locations around the world. When someone makes a change to a file - like updating a document or saving a new version - all these servers need to know about the change. The traditional way of doing this is like calling each server one by one to tell them about the change, which takes time and uses a lot of network resources.

LAYOUT_WCC solves this problem by introducing a smarter way to handle these updates. Instead of notifying every server about every change, it only tells the servers that actually need to know about specific changes. It's like having a smart notification system that only alerts the people who really need to know about something.

## Why Does This Matter? ðŸ’¡
If you're working with:
- Large files spread across multiple servers
- Systems that need to stay synchronized
- Applications where performance is crucial

Then this solution helps by:
- Making file updates faster
- Using less network bandwidth
- Reducing server load
- Improving overall system reliability

## Features âœ¨
- **Smart Updates**: Only sends changes to servers that need them
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically handles network issues and retries
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes caching and connection pooling
- **Easy Integration**: Works with existing NFS systems
- **Secure**: Supports SSL/TLS encryption
- **Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and logging
